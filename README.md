## KubeView

KubeView is a tool that gathers information from your Kubernetes YAML files in a specified path. 

### Building

To build the tool (MacOS, Linux and Windows):
 - clone the repository
 - run `astilectron-bundler -v` in the cloned folder
 
 ### Usage
 Run `KubeView -h` to get information for the available flags. 
 By default the application will try to open the assets folder in the current working directory.
